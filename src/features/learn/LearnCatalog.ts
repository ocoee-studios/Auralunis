    title: "What is the Solar System?",
    level: "beginner",
    summary: "The Solar System is the Sun and everything gravitationally bound to it: planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and dust.",
    body: "Our Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. The Sun ignited at the center, and the leftover material settled into a spinning disk that became the planets.\n\nEverything you watch move against the stars — the planets, the Moon, the occasional comet — belongs to this family, held in orbit by the Sun's gravity. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and far out in the dark, the Oort Cloud where comets are born.",
    keyFacts: [
      "The Sun contains most of the Solar System’s mass.",
      "Planets orbit the Sun along predictable paths.",

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Moon phases happen because we see different portions of the Moon’s sunlit half as it orbits Earth.",
    body: "The Moon makes no light of its own — it shines by reflecting sunlight. As it orbits Earth, the angle between the Sun, Earth, and Moon changes, so we see more or less of its lit half. That full cycle from New to Full and back is called a lunation, and it takes about 29.5 days.\n\nA waxing Moon grows fuller night by night and sets after sunset, perfect for early-evening viewing. A waning Moon shrinks and rises late. The terminator — the line dividing lit from shadowed terrain — is where shadows are longest and craters look the most dramatic through binoculars.",
    keyFacts: [
      "New Moon means the sunlit side faces mostly away from Earth.",
      "Full Moon means the sunlit side faces Earth.",

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are rocky inner planets. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are large outer planets.",
    body: "The four inner planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars — are small, dense, and rocky, close enough to the Sun that they lost most of their light gases long ago. The four outer planets are giants: Jupiter and Saturn are mostly hydrogen and helium, while Uranus and Neptune hold more water, ammonia, and methane ices.\n\nTo the naked eye, Venus and Jupiter are brilliant and unmistakable, Mars glows distinctly orange, and Saturn shines a steady gold. A quick trick: unlike stars, planets barely twinkle — their tiny disks hold steady where a point-like star shimmers.",
    keyFacts: [

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Constellations are named regions of the sky. Their star patterns helped people navigate, tell stories, and track seasons.",
    body: "A constellation is a pattern the eye links together, but the stars in it usually lie at wildly different distances — they only look close because they fall along the same line of sight. The 88 modern constellations divide the entire sky into regions, like countries on a map.\n\nWhich ones you can see depends on the season and your latitude, because Earth's night side faces different parts of space as we orbit the Sun. Learn a few bright anchor patterns first — Orion in winter, the Summer Triangle overhead in summer, the Big Dipper year-round in the north — and they become signposts to everything else.",

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "A star looks bright because of its true luminosity, distance from Earth, color, and atmospheric conditions.",
    body: "How bright a star looks — its apparent magnitude — depends on both how much light it truly puts out and how far away it is. A modest nearby star can easily outshine a brilliant distant one. The scale runs backward: lower numbers are brighter, and each step of 1 magnitude is about 2.5× in brightness.\n\nColor is a thermometer. Blue-white stars like Rigel are scorching hot; yellow stars like our Sun are middling; orange and red stars like Betelgeuse are comparatively cool. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, is both genuinely luminous and close — just 8.6 light-years away.",

    summary: "Nebulae are clouds of gas and dust. Some are star nurseries, some are the remains of dying stars, and some block light behind them.",
    body: "Nebulae are vast clouds of gas and dust drifting between the stars. Emission nebulae like the Orion Nebula glow because hot young stars energize their gas; reflection nebulae shine by scattering nearby starlight; dark nebulae are dense enough to blot out the light behind them.\n\nMany are stellar nurseries, where gravity slowly pulls gas together into new stars. Others mark endings — planetary nebulae are glowing shells puffed off by dying Sun-like stars, and supernova remnants are the wreckage of massive stars that exploded. Under dark skies the Orion Nebula is visible to the naked eye as a faint fuzzy patch in Orion's sword.",

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Galaxies are vast islands of stars — millions to trillions of them — bound by gravity, often spiralling around a bright core.",
    body: "A galaxy is an enormous gravitationally bound system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter. Spiral galaxies like our Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy have flat rotating disks with curving arms; elliptical galaxies are smooth, rounded swarms of older stars; irregular galaxies have no clear shape, often disturbed by past collisions.\n\nThey range from dwarf galaxies of a few million stars to giants holding many trillions. Most lie far beyond our own — the nearest large spiral, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light-years away, yet on a dark night it shows to the naked eye as a faint elongated smudge. Through a telescope, galaxies reveal cores, arms, and dust lanes.",

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Star clusters are groups of stars born together from one cloud — loose open clusters of young stars, or dense globular clusters of ancient ones.",
    body: "Star clusters are families of stars that formed together from a single collapsing cloud of gas, so they share an age and a starting chemistry. Open clusters like the Pleiades are loose, irregular groups of a few hundred young, hot stars scattered along the Milky Way's disk. Globular clusters are tight, spherical swarms of hundreds of thousands of very old stars orbiting in the galaxy's halo.\n\nBecause a cluster's stars are all the same distance and age, astronomers use them to study how stars evolve. The Pleiades, in Taurus, is the most famous open cluster — a small dipper-shaped knot of blue stars easily seen with the naked eye.",
    keyFacts: [

    level: "beginner",
    summary: "Supernova remnants are the expanding shells of glowing gas left behind when a massive star ends its life in a colossal explosion.",
    body: "When a massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses and the star detonates as a supernova, briefly outshining its entire galaxy. The blast hurls the star's outer layers into space at thousands of kilometres per second, sweeping up surrounding gas into a glowing, expanding shell — a supernova remnant.\n\nThese remnants seed the galaxy with the heavy elements forged in the explosion, the raw material for new stars and planets. The Crab Nebula in Taurus is the wreckage of a star seen to explode in the year 1054; at its heart spins a pulsar, the dense neutron-star core left behind.",

    summary: "The Milky Way band is the glowing plane of our galaxy seen from inside it, filled with stars, dust lanes, and deep-sky regions.",
    body: "The Milky Way band is our own galaxy seen edge-on from the inside. We sit about two-thirds of the way out in a flat spiral disk, so when we look along the plane of that disk we see the merged glow of billions of distant stars as a soft river of light.\n\nIts brightest, richest stretch lies toward the constellation Sagittarius — the direction of the galactic core. Crossing the band are the dark lanes of the Great Rift, dust clouds that block the starlight behind them. You need genuinely dark skies and little moonlight to see it well; from a city, light pollution washes it out entirely.",

On your first night, simply find it and notice three things — its phase (how much is lit), its brightness, and roughly where it sits above the horizon.\n\nThen check tomorrow's moonrise and moonset times so you know when to look again. The Moon drifts about 12° east each night and rises roughly 50 minutes later, making it a perfect first lesson in how the whole sky moves.
