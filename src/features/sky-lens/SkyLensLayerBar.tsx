// divider and a fixed 44x44 icon-only Layers button. Text-only + the "Constell." dock
// shorthand leaves ~6pt of real gap between every control at 430pt — breathing room, not
// a crammed strip. Pills flex-shrink padding (never text) as a safety net on narrow
// devices. The full word "Constellations" is unchanged everywhere else.
